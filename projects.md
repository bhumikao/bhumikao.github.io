### Modelling of Tidal Circulation and Sediment Transport in the Gulf of Cambay

* To formulate a model of flow patterns of sediments in the gulf
* Theoretical study of circulation pattern and sediment transportation in rivers and estuaries from
* various research papers and journals
* Estimated the velocity profiles and dispersion coefficient for the gulf
* Use the concepts of **computational fluid dynamics** to simulate sediment flow and transport
* For near shore flow, dispersion need to be considered in both longitudinal and transverse directions
* Fisher’s formulation gave partially accurate value of Dispersion Coefficient


### Estimation and Partitioning of Evapotranspiration

* To formulate a model for partitioning of evapotranspiration in an agricultural field
* Review of various methods and models used for measurement and partitioning of evapotranspiration from journals and research papers
* To calculate the potential evapotranspiration and scale it down to evaporation, transpiration and interception. Also using Bowen Ratio Energy Balance Method (BREB) for estimation of actual evapotranspiration.
* Analyzing the effect of different time averaging and advection on the accuracy of BREB method
* Using the eddy co-variance tower data and Lysimeter data for assesment of the results


### Bridge Design and Construction
* Tutored a group of 5 first year students about structural analysis and designing
* Designed and simulated building frames and bridges using SAP2000
* Designed, simulated and constructed a bridge of 2m span and tested it on shake table
