### Modelling of Tidal Circulation and Sediment Transport in the Gulf of Cambay

* To formulate a model of flow patterns of sediments in the gulf
* Theoretical study of circulation pattern and sediment transportation in rivers and estuaries from
* various research papers and journals
* Estimated the velocity profiles and dispersion coefficient for the gulf
* Use the concepts of **computational fluid dynamics** to simulate sediment flow and transport
* For near shore flow, dispersion need to be considered in both longitudinal and transverse directions
* Fisherâ€™s formulation gave partially accurate value of Dispersion Coefficient
